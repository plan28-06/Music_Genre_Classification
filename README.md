# Music_Genre_Classification

This project implements a music genre classification system using handcrafted audio features extracted from raw `.wav` files.  
Features such as MFCCs, chroma, spectral, and rhythm descriptors are used to represent musical characteristics.  
Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are trained and evaluated for multi-class genre prediction.  
XGBoost achieved a marginal (~0.5%) accuracy improvement over Random Forest, indicating that both models perform at a comparable level on the extracted features.
